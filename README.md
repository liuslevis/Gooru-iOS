Gooru-iOS
=========

The Gooru iPad app transforms the studying experience, providing you with a no-fuss way to share collections with your students. Students can instantly access their assignments, and they can study collections or quizzes in the classroom or on the go. Both teachers and students can also easily discover new learning resources using Gooru Search, accessible on the app. We encourage you to create Classpages on the web to enjoy the complete benefit of the Gooru iPad experience.
